You're 100% right — timing is likely the **core issue** behind consistently low or zero scores, even when the form looks good. Let’s isolate that and fix it properly.

## 🧠 Why Timing Is Breaking Your Score

### ❌ Current Problem:

You're likely comparing:

```
userFrame[i] ↔ referenceFrame[i]
```

But the user may perform the move just **½ second later**, so:

* Angles are correct
* Timing offset ruins alignment
* Score becomes 0 despite good form

---

## ✅ Goal: Align Based on Motion, Not Wall Clock

We need to **find the best-matching reference frame for each user frame**, even if it’s not at the exact same timestamp.

---

## 🔁 Fix: Use Frame-Wise Dynamic Alignment (without full DTW for now)

Here’s a simple plan:

### **1. Match Each User Frame to Nearest Reference Window**

For each user frame:

* Search ±10 reference frames
* Compare angle differences
* Pick the reference frame with the **lowest total angle error**

```ts
for (let offset = -10; offset <= 10; offset++) {
  const refIndex = userFrameIndex + offset;
  if (refIndex valid) {
    compute average joint angle error;
    if (error < bestError) {
      bestMatch = refIndex;
    }
  }
}
```

This allows the system to "slide" the reference video timeline until it best fits the user's real performance — forgiving minor delays.

---

### **2. Add Delay-Based Penalty (Soft, Optional)**

Once best-aligned:

* If delay = 0 → no penalty
* If delay = 2 frames → subtract 3 points
* If delay = 5+ → subtract 10+

This allows delay to **influence**, but not destroy the score.

---

### **3. (Optional) Show User a Timing Feedback Label**

* “Try to match the speed of the reference”
* “You're moving too fast”
* “Good timing!”

This makes timing correction **actionable**.

## 🔁 Instructions for Replit Agent

You can say:

> “Fix the test alignment logic to allow for timing mismatches. For each user pose frame, compare it to reference frames within a ±10 frame window. Use the reference frame with the smallest average joint angle difference. Use that for scoring instead of frame-by-frame comparison.”
